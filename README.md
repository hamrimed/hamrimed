My name is Mohamed Hamri and I'm a developer who is passionate about all things Java. I have experience building applications using a variety of Java frameworks, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.

But I'm not just a one-trick pony! I'm also open to learning new technologies and taking on new challenges. In my opinion, the best developers are the ones who are constantly learning and growing, and I'm no exception.

If you have a project that could use a developer with a strong foundation in Java and a willingness to learn and grow, I'd love to be a part of your team. Here's a quick rundown of my skills and experience:

# Personal Interests

In my free time, I love staying up-to-date with the latest trends and developments in the tech world. I enjoy reading technical blogs and articles, participating in online coding challenges and hackathons, and attending industry events and conferences.

I'm also a big believer in the power of collaboration and community. I love participating in open source projects and contributing to the development community through forums, blogs, and other online platforms.
